When I was reading the news of Jubair's death, I remember Anand.
Our classmate Anand was similarly killed in the internal conflict of BCL during the previous Awami League regime at the same university.
His assassins also included his classmates.
There was no trial of that incident.
At that time, general students could not stimulate any strong movement against the killing.
But today students are united.
It does not matter what party or organization they do, they will not accept the death of anyone in the educational institutions.
After the death of Anand, two factions of the Chhatra League of Jahangirnagar University were identified as rapists and murderers.
With the Awami League-led grand alliance government coming to power, the influence of power was found in Jahangirnagar and several other universities.
Such incidents occurred quite a few times;
A series of clash occurs between themselves.
However, Zubair's killing draws attention to some other factors.
The biggest allegation surrounding this killing is against the administration, the head of this administration is a teacher.
The Vice Chancellor of the University is regarded as the 'guardian'.
It is the responsibility of him all to look after everyone of the institution.
He can not deny responsibility for the death of a student in his institution.
It is a matter of sorrow that the people in the administration's most powerful posts often forget that their first identity is 'teacher'.
Student-teacher relationship is for the whole life- it is not limited within institutional boundaries.
But they use ruling party's student wing workers in many ways to exercise power in the ongoing teachers' politics.
The vice-chancellor himself maintains terrorism, this was never seen so clearly before.
In fact, what is the fear of a VC?
Fear of general students?
Or the fear of losing the post?
The university's students did not do anything outside the systematic process of raising their demands.
More concerning facts has been added to the ongoing movement of students and teachers at Jahangirnagar University.
The teachers were divided.
The Proctor has disrespected the president of the teachers' association.
Clash has happened.
A group of teachers is trying to boycott classes, as opposed to another group, trying to prove that the university is running at normal pace.
Jahangirnagar University teachers' politics are not like other universities.
The groups are like rainbow.
Awami League, BNP, Left and Jamaat remain in the same camp.
Here the factions are identified as for and against VC.
Students have been tortured in some of the other universities too.
The movement is underway at the Jagannath University.
Chhatra League had harassed the Vice-Chancellor on teacher recruitment.
The officials of the administrative building have been disgruntled by them.
Yet, the VC did not feel ashamed .
Because, maybe his honor ​​are now mortgaged to power.
Chattra League attacks have been carried out in the procession of the left organizations
the girls of the left-leaning organizations have been attacked.
The Vice Chancellor did no feel any problem for that.
But his honor were disregarded when students locked the bank's main gate at one stage of the ongoing movement of university students under the leadership of the left-leaning student organizations against the increased pay-fees and some of their teachers had an argument with them.
Then, the teachers protests the incident the next day wearing black batches and proclaiming the case against the protesting students.
Alas!
How pathetic the impact of power is!
Last year many of the Vice-Chancellors went to meet the Prime Minister under the chairmanship of the University Grants Commission.
There was a demand among the many demands that they got equal respect like the MP's.
It was understood what the Vice-Chancellors now want.
The tendency of asking more power is the cause of the current situation of the universities.
This Vice-Chancellors look like the Faust of today.
They are busy to sell their soul in exchange for money, glory, prestige.
The leaders of Chhatra League or Chhatra Dal are the arms to keep their position.
The teacher is constantly begging for power to the students.
Maybe they do not value it, but we feel slighted as their colleagues;
Our head bow down out of shame.
Our classmates have returned from the university being dead, we can not save our students;
Such as, we could not save Abu Bakr, the student of the history and culture of Islam of Dhaka University.
Why can we not ensure the security of the students?
Life and death of the campus
Zubair's visible and invisible killers
After some days there will grow grass the grass in Jubayer's grave, and media's attention will shift towards other killings.
There will be no shortage of events for protests in Sonar Bangla.
These factories will continue to be full;
We will be mourning and protesting.
But situation will not change.
But what do we do with Zubair's visible body and invisible killers?
The investigation report will be written - The brutal murder has been done, but murderers have not been identified.
For example, the murderers of DU student Abu Bakr disappeared after almost two years.
University is the institution of higher education and higher morality.
The second aspect of the murder of Zubair is barbarism.
He was taken away in front of everyone's eyes, and at the public place, under the open sky, was killed after one hour.
The scalp and various parts of the body are broken by rod.
There were innumerable wounds in his body.
The boy died because of dripping blood through those wounds.
Readers, think of the consequences of such brutality on your body;
Or imagine this is done with your loved ones, or imagine that you appear as a witness in that barbarous murder scene;
Then tell, how many degrees of brutality are inflicted on Zubair?
If your child, your brother, your friend or your classmates or relatives or neighbors have such barbarity, will you shake hand with him?
Will you accept them as your child, your brother, your friend or your classmate or relative or neighbor?
I do not know what will you do, but Jahangirnagar University administration did not left any attempt to protect the killers of Jubair.
The Vice-Chancellor's first statement was 'Do not believe that BCL can do this'.
He said that there are BCL committee in JU, the central committee of BCL supported it.
But, honorable Vice-Chancellor , why did you go to the anniversary celebration of BCL in JU campus on January 31, 2011?
Whom was you feeding cake?
Is he not Asgar Ali, the joint secretary of the BCL's suspended committee?
Asghar Ali and his staff are involved in the murder of Jubair
The vice chancellor temporarily expelled three Chhatra League activists who are accused of murder in order to save them.
Afterwards, he expelled them permanently under the pressure of movement.
But all these these days they have strengthened the administration's hand of university, and suppressed student movement.
They could stay above the trial after hijacking, did not they?
This question arises, who gave them the freedom that the few students who were enjoying the freedom?
Jubayer's two identified murderers were rescued by Proctor.
The Vice-Chancellor of Jahangirnagar University and his supporters have kept such a systematic procedure, which is not unusual for the good of such incidents.
Therefore, the procedural liability of the university administration can not be denied in Jubayer killing.
Proctor has resigned following the demands of the situation ,but obligation of the owner of the order cannot be avoided by resignation?
Most importantly, Zubair informed the Proctor along with administration about the danger before going for exam.
A petition was submitted to the administration on this matter.
His classmates claims that he called the proctor on the day of the incident asking for protection.
It has to be recorded in his mobile phone call list or phone company.
See the Prothom Alo of January 11, the responsibility of administrative politics will be more clear on the murder of Zubair and its aftermath.
For these reasons, Zubair's father has lost faith i university authorities and demanded jurisdictional justice.
This is not the end, the news has been told that the administration has removed the security officer following the demands of the students.
Actually he was removed from the position of the security officer to the Statistics Department's officer.
Even children won't call it punishment.
This person was an associate of the rapist group in 1999.
Unelected Vice Chancellor Sharif Enamul Kabir made him a security officer.
THe VC himself is well established as the mediator of this.
There are 200 newly recruited teachers along with the old teachers to protect him.
Most of them have been appointed not for eligibility criteria, but by party favor.
Their clash in the meeting of the teachers' association proves how powerful the employer's hands were.
For more than 20-30 years they will be appointed as a teacher of the university, who will be responsible for the loss of Jahangirnagar University and its present and future students.
These impotents are more involved in the procurement administrative facilities than educative activities.
Who is more successful than these impotent teachers in destroying a university?
Not only Jahangirnagar, the situation of the rest of the public university in the country is more or less like this.
It is possible for the criminal administration to sit on the campus and create events after events of barbaric stature.
Those who killed by Jubair, should be punished.
This protest will not carry any meaning.
Jubayer's death demands judicial investigation.
Now the question is, whether the government, the education adviser, the UGCees will prolong the death of the universities, or will it lead to death by going on?
In the last years, the popular movements of all the public universities of the country were to close the control of autocracy and terrorism.
To save higher education, these two will have to be terminated.
Physical punishment of students should be stopped.
Teacher's ruthless behavior
Their roguery is the sign of the lives of the young people.
They will laugh, play, and run to and fro.
They will also be attentive to study.
That is their religion.
Whether they are in school or at home, they will always be restless.
It should not be seen as unfair.
But sadly, in our country, the life of children from eternity is considered as rude.
They were resorted by a catastrophic way to beating them.
The result is the opposite.
Many children become lifeless in fear of being beaten up.
Some others become desperate.
Many of them become inhuman when they are grown up.
Many behave violently.
This is the affect of injustice towards them.
A teacher of Kendua Jahari Spray Government High School in Netrakona proved to be a disqualified teacher by kicking-up a six-year-old meritorious child.
According to the report published in the Prothom Alo on Sunday, it has been shown that inhuman behavior has been done to the child's education due to creating slightest chaos in class.
The child might have to suffer from mental disorder forever because of the fear that has been created in his mind.
Who will bear the responsibility of making sick child from a joyous boy?
How did such inhuman behavior in government schools happen?
Physical torture in the classroom has been banned.
Ministry of Education has issued circular on this.
Don't the teacher know this?
Or does he think that complying with those circulars is not compulsory?
Whether the accused teacher has given physical punishment to the child, it should be confirmed through proper investigation.
If he has done unlawful work, he will have to be given an exemplary punishment.
For the sake of an English proverb, it is said that the children go astray if they do not be beaten up.
Modern civilization does not think this;
Instead, promote loving care for winning the mind of the children.
Friendly behavior is essential for education.
This is a definite decision in modern science of child psychology.
But it is a matter of regret that many wise-skilled teachers do not want to accept it.
They beat students with cane.
This cruelty has to be abandoned.
Education and rattan can not go together.
PSC Exam
What needs to be done for improvement
For the second time, students can enjoy the results of the primary examination.
About 48 percent of the candidates passed the highest class.
40-50 years ago, not even 10 percent of the examinees were promoted in the next class.
However, there was no public examination system for primary or junior classes.
But lately, there are various types of examinations for our young students.
30 lakh students were not tested together before.
It is not impossible to have incompatibilities and misconceptions to evaluate all those exams at the shortest time.
Apart from that, if the area's exam papers were seen by the teachers in the area, then the possibility of the inflation of number cannot be avoided.
The results of SSC and HSC and results in admission tests of higher education institutions are largely dominated by schools and colleges in the capital.
And why not.
The infrastructure in the schools and colleges of the capital are far better then that of outside.
The teachers excellence and experience are better.
Educational equipments are more.
In addition, there are several types of coaching opportunities.
40-50 years ago, the children of the village were markedly on the merit list.
That era has ended now.
Education is now considered as a product.
Education is bought by money.
Therefore, it is difficult to get education from the neglected area.
In such a situation, when the presence of the village in higher education is gradually decreasing, then the results of the primary closing examination can not be matched by the futility of the capital and the success of the village.
It takes two to three years of preparation for admission in the renowned schools in city.
As a result, in many cases, the age of the students is as high, so much is the level of knowledge.
In addition, there are more teacher who are experienced in teaching and enrichment of educational materials.
Even then, among the 57 people in the merit list, there are only five from whole capital, whereas nine from Tangail's Bindubabasini Girls' High School!
The students of the remote areas of lesser known schoolshave got place in the merit list.
It is undoubtedly an optimistic tradition.
If this outcome is devoid of defect in the normal level, it is undoubtedly a hope for our country's neglected population and the underprivileged people.
But about three million students' exams can be examined in such a short time, in the form of assessment, their management, the introduction of the creative approach, perhaps the assessment of the field based assessments - all of these can lead to the error of progressive levels.
Therefore, it is advisable to have check and balance for new methods to be efective.
But if this new innovative method can be evaluated through alternate methods, then it may be possible to reduce its deficiencies to acceptable levels.
The primary scholarship will be given on the basis of these results.
We have given all students the opportunity to participate in public examinations.
So, it is normal that not everyone will come in the competition of excellence, even in the countries with all opportunities this does not happen.
I think conducting a primary scholarship test, the acceptance of the initial closing test can be verified with its results.
Congratulations to the child of Tangail who got 598 out of 600.
In order to encourage the children of all over the country, the answer script of this boy should be printed on a national daily, others will know what level of correctness and excellence is needed.
There is a practice to publish good answer papers in West Bengal.
Some proposals are presented to make the primary closing test better and enrich.
1. 50 percent of the number should be allocated for objective questions, so that the relative performance of students in different areas can be measured.
Technology can be used to do the job accurately.
2. It should be taken into consideration if it is realistic to evaluate the examination script of one area by teachers of different areas so that nepotism does not cause inflation in marks.
3.A scholarship examination can be arranged with top twenty thousand students of this exam.
Since the number of students are less the evaluation is likely to be more accurate.
If the results of this scholarship examination are consistent with the results of the closing test, then we are more confident about the accuracy of our current system.
There is no alternative of competition in education to achieve excellence.
We need to encourage our children's education by making the scholarship exam more delightful.
Education-administration
Private college audit!
There is a work called ministry audit in the government's MPO-approved private educational institutions.
In this process, the Ministry of Education usually provides an auditor to inspect the infrastructure, manpower, year-wise income-expenditure, recruitment and provide a report of the scheduled educational institutions.
Such an audit may bring into light the invalid recruitment of a teacher who is teaching for 10-15 years, or even 20 years.
That is, in this 10-15-20 years, standing in front of thousands of students to help in their studies in return for the wage is illegal in a teacher's life!
What's the reason?
Because, in the recruitment process, there were supposed to be at least three candidates, there were two;
As a representative of the directorate of education board there supposed to be a professor in the viva board from a govt. college, but there were an assistant professor;
As an expert of the subject there supposed to be an assistant professor, but there were a lecturer.
Is it possible in reality for a person to know all these conditions, or is it necessary for him to know these?
So who is responsible for the illegality of the recruitment process?
Whoever the responsibility, it must be carried out by the teacher,
Who thought that teaching was a clean and fairly respectable profession.
After three days, head of the institution told the teachers and employees that phone calls from Dhaka are being communicated.
It's hard to tell the truth.
Because most heads of the private schools in remote area (mostly not all) are thieves.
These teachers and employees are not in any way to verify whether the Inspector-Auditor is really asking for excise, or whether the head of the organization is taking money from teachers or employees, or the amount of bribe being claimed is increased.
Discussion has been done with the head of the organization about the deal.
To show example in this context, one topic of the last October can be drawn.
The improvement in the pay scale due to the completion of the eight-year term of the private college teachers' employment was closed for several years.
As the process of starting the time scale was restarted, newspapers published news on the preparation of the procurement process.
The accelerated intervention of the honorable education minister is unbelievable but it is true that to change the time scale no excise was needed.
Because the convenor of the committee, Dipak Kumar Nag, Director General (Administration), MAUSI reports, 'No money is needed'
Who is taking money, tell me.
We're working dawn to dusk closing the door.
Time scale can be reached by 18 (October) '.
Then it can not be said that the education ministry has taken a bribe.
However, many of the heads of the private colleges of the college have not sent the necessary documents of the teachers or employees in Dhaka without taking bribe, or have called the teachers and staff from Dhaka, 'bribe is needed, send money through SA transport'.
Though the things written till now are crystal clear knowledge from experience, it is not possible to present any documentary evidence.
Because there exists widespread irregularities, corruption, arbitrary conduct, relativity and inefficiency and inefficiency in the establishment and management of non-governmental educational institutes of Bangladesh, especially private colleges established in the nineteenth century and later.
There can also be found examples of the fact that five or six of MA pass has opened a college one of whom is made acting principal covering four km or fewer area of rural area.
After this, the subject-based MA, MSC, MCom Pass people has been recruited as lecturer taking bribe, and students were made to admit by showing various temptations.
After five to seven years of continuing this way, each college stood with two or three-four hundred students and 40-50-60 teachers-employees.
So, from the time of birth, irregularities and corruption were attributed to these colleges.
These irregularities-corruption become a great scope in the time of the ministerial audit for the dishonest instructor and the inspectors.
And it is known to everyone that there is no evidence of such transactions.
In this condition ministry-audit is a poison to the teachers and employees of the private educational institutions.
As a result of the courage, determination and steps of the education minister, our education system seems to be changing.
Formation of a modern and potential national education policy is one of those steps.
Is it not possible to think about this ministry-audit?
The good news for the country is that our education secretary is a poet.
Bribing is not only a financial loss, but a person's status as a person is also falling on the ground.
It is necessary to look into this side.
Take a quick step to change the books.
Mistakes in textbooks
'Textbook Festival' for students to get new books started in the first day of the new year.
Already the distribution work is almost done.
It is considered as a big event to distribute about 23 million books free of cost to the students.
But a lot of mistakes in the printed book begin to get caught, so success faces a bit of halt.
According to the report of the Prothom Alo representative of Cox's Bazar and Khulna, numerous mistakes have been found in the primary textbooks distributed in these two districts.
The mistakes are basically about printing and binding.
Such mistakes are not unusual while printing so much books.
It could have been easily avoided if steps were taken to make a little sort of selection before distributing.
It is a great pleasure for the students to have new books.
But after getting the book, if there is a mistake in printing and binding, it is also normal to be frustrated.
These books are being sent back and changed from the educational institutions.
But in what amount of books do such inconsistencies have determines whether it is possible to change it from excess reserves.
An official of Khulna, involved in the distribution of books, expressed the apprehension.
He said, many books are coming back due to the problems of printing and binding from the educational institutions.
It is being replaced because of some additional reserves, but if the number of returning books increases, then there will be problem.
As a result, it is very important to get an idea about the number of defective books and take action accordingly.
We hope that everyone will come forward to redress this success of distributing books among the students at free and will take the necessary steps to change the defective books distributed as soon as possible.
At the same time, we also want to emphasize the issue of taking such a problem into consideration.
If that happens then it will be possible to completely make the book distribution program error free.
JSC test
Drop out, failing
First I remember the girl who chose to commit suicide after failing in the exam and not being able to tolerate her parents rebuking.
She has committed suicide hanging herself with the ceiling fan.
She has gone to the world of eternity turning all slander, humiliation, humiliation into love.
Her name is Tania Ahmed.
Se failed in mathematics in the JSC examination from the Bangladesh Sports Educational Institution (BKSP) Public School of Savar.
The girl was the only child of her parents.
For this reason, they could not accept the failure of the girl and rebuke her.
They can not be blamed.
Because there is no training system to be the ideal parent or guardian in our country.
Now she is only memory to her parents and other members of her family.
She is memory to us too.
We did not see her, this is the truth.
But we know of many young people, who do not bear any kind of attack on their personalities.
And we are strange,we wait a year with great enthusiasm to hear or read a news like this.
More lives are gone.
This year's death has been one, but millions of children are going to be living death.
Let's take a look at the results of the last two years of primary education and the results of the Junior School Certificate Examinations held for the first time in 2010.
Ehsan Rafiq, student of Dhaka University's Salimullah Muslim (SM) Hall, can not look at the light.
He is passing days lying in the dark room.
He has pain all over the body.
The family is preparing to take him to India for treatment.
On the night of February 6, Ehsan was tortured by BCL leaders and workers.
From two in the morning to two o'clock in the noon, Ehsan was beaten three times.
His forehead and nose burst out in blood.
He was detained in the room of president of BCL unit of the hall, Tahsan Ahmed.
After a few rounds of medical treatment in Dhaka, the family has taken Ehsan to the village home.
We talked with Ehsan on Thursday evening.
He is lying in his room putting off the light.
When to speak, he says he lies putting of the light in the day too.
It is not possible for him to see through the light.
He can not sit head high because of pain.
Ehsan's father Rafiqul Islam said to Prothom Alo, he is preparing to take him to India for quick treatment.
He has requested for a passport on Wednesday.
He has to bear the expenses of treatment in Dhaka, currently at home and for treatment in India too.
He expressed his anger because the university administration had no initiative in this regard.
University administration should have bear the expenses of the treatment of Ehsan.
These cannot be tolerated.
Haven't got justice, treatment was not given!
Because the identity of the criminal is a bit different!
In 2010, three lakh 65 thousand 70 students dropped out.
In 2009 this number was 3 lakh 59 thousand 841.
The number increased by more than six thousand.
In the year 2010, two lakh 83 thousand 132 students were absent in the center in PSC exam.
This result has two sides in happiness and sorrow.
In 2010, 11.52 thousand 536 students participated in the Junior School Certificate Examination held in Creative Question Method.
Of these, 81 thousand 720 were absent.
367 schools in junior level and 2787 schools in primary level had zero pass rate.
In Anand schools run under the Reaching Out School of Children Program, in 2010, 1,434,66 students of 6,661 Ananda School registered.
Of these, 66 thousand 817 were absent.
No two students of 2,221 schools have passed.
False examinees have been found in privately operated schools and the results of these schools are severely bad.
Already the permission to run schools of about 400 non-government organizations in 60 upazilas has been canceled on the charge of fraud.
In addition to strengthening the supervision of the ministry in the schools, several organizations have been closed.
But it can not be a permanent solution.
Arrangement for the education of the children of deprived and poor families has been done without any long-term plan.
To manage the education of a special system, all of them, who were involved in implementing the project, were required to introduce a lot of responsibilities, including the project officers, teachers, primary education directorate and the person from the primary and mass education ministry.
Needless to say, education is not a wild tree that it will grow as it wishes.
To achieve the desired goal of education by a human child, educational institutions need nice environment,up to date textbok, teaching method, trained teacher, the ability to understand the child.
At the time of evaluation, the child can be valued on learning.
Only then we can expect good results from him.
But sadly, even if there is no shortage, many teachers or administrators do not do these things with utmost sincerity in implementing the education program.
The picture of the results in the two sectors indicates that.
The school environment must be friendly.
Most of our country's educational institutions do not have playgrounds, there is no free environment.
Day by day space will lessen.
Children will not get a chance to play without a specified place and time.
They won't get a chance to learn in the free environment.
This fact has to be accepted by everyone.
Therefore, it will be wise to focus on how to better this narrow environment into education friendly, pleasant place.
It is needed to decide how to better utilize this narrow environment to make the students reach their desired goal.
To improve the relationship between students and guardians, the activities covered by the educational institutions should be implemented more effectively.
In addition to organizing guardians assembly in the institutions, there need to be arrangements for the child-guardian, where they will jointly solve any problem.
Apart from this, the media of the country will also have to organize various activities related to family education, social education, education of children in different trends and awareness building activities.
Along with parents the school teachers and managing committee have to increase their work.
However, the activities must be educational-centric.
There is no alternative to educational materials for students to learn.
Child's education lasts more if eye-catching educational equipments are used before or in time of teaching them.
It has been said since long to use hand made materials in the class since long.
But how many teachers of our country do that work?
It is not possible to stop dropout in the educational institutions without ensuring the student's regular attendance.
They can understand the importance of sitting for exam only when they are regularly present in the school.
Naturally, a student who does not attend classes creates a tendency to feel institutional education inappropriate.
As well as in the examination, he faces a kind of exam fear in his mind.
Because he did not prepare himself for testing all year.
So, without further delay it is necessary to make the steps in reality in the light of importance of child education.
It is must to reduce drop outs, and increase pass rates.
JSC exam results
The results of the eighth grade junior school certificate exam held for the first time under the eight education boards of the country were not encouraging.
The average pass rate of the country is 71.34 percent;
The number of such candidates who received the highest grade, GPA-5, is also very small.
Most of the candidates got grade in between GPA-2 and GPA-3.
The picture is a lot worse compared to the results of the primary education concluding examination.
The reason behind this can be found by the teachers and related people.
This is the the first time the test was done, so it is not unusual to have some weaknesses.
In general students prepare for the public examination on the light of previous years questions.
The teachers who give the 'suggestions' also give the same question in the previous year's question papers.
There was no such opportunity in this examination.
But it does not make any difference in knowledge acquired by the learners.
Girls' results are better than boys in the primary stage, but this examination of the eighth grade shows that boys are ahead.
It should also be examined as to what might be the reason.
It can be noted here that if the care and attention towards girls' education is reduced by the family or school at the top level.
More than 80 thousand students did not participate in the exam even after registering for the exam.
The reason why this huge number of children dropped from education in the eighth grade is also needed to be examined.
Highest effort should be ensured so that students do not drop out until the Higher Secondary level.
Because, to survive in this 21st century world, people have to be transformed into educated labour force to deal with the increasing population pressure.
In order to achieve that, everyone has to be educated upto higher secondary level.
None can be allowed to drop out at eight grade.
We hope that the results of this exam will be better in the coming years.
However, it should not be the only concern look at the good results, but students, teachers, parents have to careful so that the quality of study is achieved.
Creative children and our responsibilities
Every child has an endless creative creed.
The scope of his thinking, the limit of imagination and the dream map are unlimited.
We- parents, siblings, teachers- determine their limitations only in the good results of the exam.
This is our cleverness, stupidity or silliness.
We think of their bright future;
Without doing good in studies, that future can not be created.
The child should do good in studies, take higher education from the university, be a doctor, be an engineer.
This is our project on children.
We will torture the child for the implementation of this project;
His will-unwillingness, feeling good-bad;
We will make him fit for our project by crushing everything of his own hobby.
The child is a different person, and is completely different, we never consider that.
We do not believe and admit that doing good in study is only one of many possible process of being great.
Whom should we blame?
The nature of the established social and state organization has become such that parents and teachers do not have any chance to think in new ways.
Our child education system is contrary to the development of child's self.
Doing good in exam by memorizing some questions can not be the promise of a school.
Even teaching the students is not the responsibility of the teacher.
The teacher's responsibility is to introduce the student to the learning process.
A chess player is first familiar with the rules of the game of chess.
But when he plays chess, in every new situation, he does not really check the book of the rules of chess;
Rather, under the rule, he tries to overcome every new situation with his own intelligence, creative talent.
the process of acquiring knowledge is also similar.
The teacher will introduce the student to the learning process and methods of acquiring knowledge.
Applying those rules to all new situations, the student will arrive at a well-informed decision.
In this case, he will learn to use his logic, imagination, creativity, thinking and intelligence.
Each student must have this freedom that he can interpret the text in his own way and be able to establish relationships with all subjects of the realm related to that lesson.
The issue of institutional education can be difficult for some child.
But this does not mean that those children are worthless.
Rather, the school has co-educational activities to identify the possibilities that many possibilities are hidden in them.
Sports, music, recitation, dance, drama, writing, science fairs, etc. is a part of various co-curricular activities.
If co-curricular activities could be conducted with equal importance then establishment through education would not be irreplaceable option.
Parents and teachers would not torture the student continuously for doing well in the examination.
But in our education system, there was never a student-friendly situation, it is not even today, and it can never be said whether it would be.
There is no scope for sports and cultural activities, no scope to write, no scope to draw.
There is no other way for students to develop diverse talent, except by writing in the exam.
Some educational institutes organize cultural events and sports annually.
These are all traditional, to some extent show off .
With this there is no relation of illuminating students diverse talents with this.
Because, these events at the end of the year cannot identify students' diverse talents.
Let's give a positive example.
That event was a huge gathering of people.
About what?
About the stories written by children.
How many children are writing stories, brings stories in the competition have no bound.
Many of these children found themselves as a writer.
From this call of dreams, from this wonderful development of imagination, maybe they won't have to return.
Lubaba Nauer, the best storyteller in the 2010 competition, dreams of becoming a writer.
Can our schools show dreams to the students?
The dreams of the child are asleep.
These dreams have to be awakened by the touch of philosophers stone.
It requires a dreamer teacher.
What else could a teacher have to give to the child without a dream?
But alas!
Where is that teacher?
Where are those completely organized educational institutions?
University of Dhaka
It's the student leader, this is the assistant professor!
'Do not greet the elder brothers, do not respect, do not come in the program- what could be done other then beating them?'
This blasphemous remark is of the BCL President of the University of Surya Sen Hall of Dhaka University.
The Prothom-alo presented it as a quote on 18 January.
It is known reading after in detail that 10-12 students of Dhaka University, all of whom, stayed in one room of Masterda Surya Sen Hall.
All of them were brought to the hall on the 17th of January in the winter and were questioned, the head was stuck on the wall and was beaten at one stage.
What is their crime?
They do not attend the BCL meeting;
The do not greet the elder brothers.
This fault of the students has been heard from the leader of BCL who has also raises the matter of his responsibilities.
On the other hand, the Hall's authority also presented a reputation for his responsibility and responsibilities to journalists.
Occasionally, such news about BCL comes in front of the of public through the media.
Not only the Chhatra League, when the political parties are in power, their students' organization goes to the universities and colleges of the country like lion goes to forest.
They are involved in various types of criminal activities, including tender, murder, kidnapping and ransom.
When Awami League was ruling in 2009, their student wing Chhatra League did not come out of this trend.
Although the Awami League-led alliance said in their the electoral pledge of 23rd rounds to change the country's political culture, to build a modern prosperous country.
The people of Bangladesh, especially young voters (the students of the same age) believe in the promises, have supported Awami League with their .
After 1973, Awami League results did not have such a big victory.
In 1996, when the Awami League came to power in the elections, their seats were below 50 percent of the time.
But the victory of 2008 was totally one-sided.
The young generation of this country was the protagonist of this victory.
Those who always want to see a developed, prosperous and modern country.
But within two weeks of the completion of two years of the government's tenure, the news that came in the newspaper again proved that 'there has not changed mind and behavior'.
Since Awami League is in power, so the BCL leaders have become kings.
They are the kings here and the students are subjects.
These people will continue to salute their kings, they will vow to them in the street, they will go to the procession without going to the examination!
If they show any disagreement, there will come down the sword of torture.
That happened in Surya Sen Hall.
Some will say it is an isolated incident or the university authorities or the top princes of that organization may take disciplinary action.
Needless to say, it will be shown off.
Because, such incidents have been going on for two years.
Awami League general secretary boasts that, "but will not tolerate any bullying", says, "Shibir has entered the Chhatra League." The Prime Minister is reluctant to cut relationship with them, whereas she is going to their program, cutting out the anniversary cake.
It has been found in the newspapers that Chhatra League has created 242 conflicts in the educational institutions in the last two years.
Of these, 190 happened inside of the educational institutions and 52 outside of the institutions.
In these clashes, 16 people were killed, more than four thousand were injured.
Many educational institutions have stopped due to their terrorism.
Maybe someone will say, 'It has been happening during the tenure of previous government too'.
Yes, true.
But still it will be happening?
It can not be accepted.
The people are not accepting.
The results of the local government elections prove it.
In this column of the Prothom Alo, we responded to the violence of BCL during different times.
The people of the country also demanded to stop this bullying at different times.
But that did not stop, Surya Sen Hall incident bears that testimony.
The response to this event is not good either.
Do Awami League leaders, government ministers understand what?
In the column on October 2 last year, in the wake of the government supporters attack on Pabna administration officials, we asked whether the leaders and workers of Jubo League-BCL leaders dug the drone for the government and the Awami League in different areas of the country!
Today the results of the municipal elections proves that the danger is true.
The danger is going on.
They are apparently identified as their party workers.
When Awami League will be in trouble, they will hide themselves and the burden of wrongdoing will be to the Awami League.
History says so.
Surya Sen Hall's provosts speech was quoted in the same report.
The topic of the tension of teachers of Dhaka University about 'Tareq Bandana' was released on September 8, 2010 in this column.
Today I see, there are still some teachers who have not learned responsibilities, have grown without moral values, have collected certificates, have not achieved humanism.
A guardian send his child to the university thinking that the university teacher will stand by the danger of his child.
When the guardian will come to know the mischief of the BCL, and the provost's speech about it, surely he will be ashamed.
The statement made by the provost, is ineligible for forgiveness.
His statement proves that he is dumb and deaf.
If a man is in danger we still run to help him, it is our childhood education, our culture.
This culture still exists in educated-illiterate, rich-poor people.
Although a teacher takes various advantages from the responsibilities of a provost, still holds the opinion that since 'someone did not come, therefore the conscience did not feel like ', then naturally it seems that our brain is really receding.
Even if many people in the community receive formal education, the teacher is still living with the mental disabilities, he proves it.
The leader of the BCL has committed crime by beating and the provost has done it by ignoring his responsibilities.
We demanded action against both of them.
Authors are university teachers, human rights activists and lawyers.
Jahangirnagar University
Open-air attacks, barriers to cultural activities
Jahangirnagar University becomes news headlines at times.
Sometimes by its beauty, and other times by their shameful activities.
The first one is nice, the second is a pity.
The beauty of nature and birds is more often printed.
When the point people comes, there come innumerable scandals and rubbish.
The number of these people is very low, but their ugly reputation reaches from Teknaf to Tentulia.
A similar incident happened recently at Jahangirnagar University's Open Stage.
January 26, 2011 was the 10th and the last day of the drama stage organized by Jahangirnagar Theater.
The invited drama team from Dhaka was ready for acting, along with that preparation was going on to honor the playwrights.
Just then a group of armed BCL activists attacked the open-stage and broke all the lights on the stage.
We are shocked, angry and hurt at this incident.
I am confessing strong hatred for the attackers.
It is doubtful whether or not this kind of attack has occurred in the 40-year history of the University.
Every progressive learner of this university knows how deep intellectualization and cultural excellence the 'MuktoMancha' have given them apart from academic studies.
There are at least four dramas and cultural festivals in the Muktomancha every year and in different names.
Usually there are many events organized throughout the year.
From this stage, voices had been against the military dictatorship, against the resistance, and alliances against anti-liberation forces was formed.
Everyone remembers this place as a source of education outside classroom.
On the 40th anniversary celebrations of the university, the students were seen to remember the similar memories.
But currently Muktomancha-centred cultural activities are not easy to operate.
Administrative restrictions and control forces have wounded the organizations.
The administration itself once tried to control the cultural field in the name of proctorial law, but did not succeed.
Firing incidents have occurred in the room of the recitation organization just a few days ago.
During the last event, the terrorism of the BCL happened.
Lighting system was broke, crowd was panicked.
Cultural organization activists were being interviewed.
The truth is that the forces of political parties hailing the progress and the liberation war have stunned the open-hearted ecstasy.
As far as I heard, the authorities of the university knew that there was a tension between the two groups since the afternoon of the incident.
Did they take any sort of security action?
Why the fighting between rival groups to gain their own domination spread fear in the administration?
It is known to all that cultural organizations have no competitive relations with the groups.
Cultural workers have always received love and respect from the students.
It is known that the university authorities do not provide any big financial assistance except for the permission of organizing the festivals.
Organizations manage their festivals depending on financial assistance from different company and personal assistance.
The things that were broken on 26 January was hired;
Who will take responsibility for these?
So, the administration failed to provide security to thousands of students of the university?
Administration is vowed to the student groups?
Or does administration have support in the opposition of the progressive cultural activities?
As we can see, the universities have gradually become the grasslands of government occupiers.
The government changes and the universities change Vice Chancellor and teachers' changes their side.
In the student groups, there happens change of groups and halls filled with violent attackers.
Universities do not find the right path of knowledge building, practice and development, under the absolutist authority of the Vice-chancellors and the destruction of government student organizations.
Like many other universities of the country, our universities are not free from political ruckus.
But it is a similar old university of the liberation of Bangladesh.
The victory of liberation war, freedom of progressive is supposed be announced here.
But this is not happening.
I do not know whether or not it will happen.
The concept of 'university' mainly taught the concept of open-mind, free land, free knowledge.
Our expectation is that university authorities will help in maintaining the progressive activities of the students organizations.
They will stand by the affected organizations.
We should not forget that, the organizations in Pakistani tenure played a historic role in achieving the independence of Bangladesh by maintaining cultural struggle.
It is important to remember that the Jahangirnagar University was the active force of the pre-Liberation War Bangladesh, where the vicious form of religious-centric politics has not been accepted neither was accepted the continuous phase of oppression;
Resistance has been created, 'Muktamanch' has become the inevitable symbol of resistance.
Growing political persecution and administrative control that is causing severe anger among the students of the university can be spread to large scale at any time.
Free the University of Dhaka from the tenant.
Extremious BCL
One of the provost was found to be disillusioned in establishing discipline at Dhaka University's dormitory.
The supervisor was insulted while supervising another hostel, because he did not get permission from BCL leader.
In another hall when the teacher went to expel the BCL leaders from the hall because of their end of studentship, they have assaulted three teachers.
There is no end to the incident, there is no limit to the power of Chhatra League.
One of the provosts submitted the resignation, others were failing to perform the duties.
In one word, the two news of the Prothom Alo on Sunday said that the administration of the university is under the strict "rule" of BCL.
BCL decides who will stay in the hall and who won't, what can be done and what cannot be done.
The occupation is so widespread that the freedom of the students and freedom of expression is near to impossible, the teachers are also upset and scared.
When the source of power is the political identity and the ruling organization, then the role of the university administration becomes the conscience of Jatrapala, who will speak good but will not have the power to intervene to prevent injustice.
If the students do any wrong, the responsibility of remedies should be done by the administration, irregularities and terrorism in the hostel should be controlled by the administration and provost.
If they fail, then the responsibility goes to the Vice Chancellor.
If he fails, then the President himself has to intervene as a Chancellor.
It clearly shows that the wrong doing is going on and the administration is failing.
The Vice-Chancellor also said, "Any activities of the halls will be run by the authorities.
There is no scope to spare the leaders and workers of the student organization.
If so, how are the terrorists getting escaped?
With what power the Chhatra League can rule 'severe' and in whose fear the administration is restrained?
Awami League or the Grand Alliance government promised that there will be no occupation of the student organization in the universities.
But during the first two years of the government, this curse of education has not been removed, rather it has become more severe.
In this occupation, the hostels have been converted into the fencing of the BCL.
Now the government has the duty to free these inhabitants of the cage.
If the Vice-Chancellor and the teacher can not play a vigorous role, then the failure is their.
Hope, the Prime Minister will see this matter.
We want a true change in the education institutions, we do not want the transition of occupation.
The violence of Chhatra League and student group has become the fate of the country's most meritorious students.
Everything seems to be like there is no government in the country.
Nobody has the power to repel them.
These wilds are becoming more powerful day by day.
The mentality to teach with punishment have to be dropped.
Boring classroom
Education with fun has been promised in this country since long.
This is followed by the modern education system.
But today still we have to talk about whether to ban students' punishment in the classroom or not to use mobile phones in the classroom.
This is a sad reality for us.
However, due to the coming of positive decision from the education ministry about these issues, it is commendable that the ministry concerned is paying attention to the subtle aspects of the education sector.
After eight months of banning physical punishment of students in the educational institutions, the Ministry of Education on Apr 21 has formulated 'Policy-2011 policy on abolishing physical and mental retardation of students in educational institutions'.
Teachers' training has been arranged and educational institutions have been asked to take action to implement this decision to ban 11 types of punishment.
Even though these ideas are being appreciated, it will not be easy to apply it to all educational institutions across the country.
For this reason, it is necessary to include these topics in broad campaign and teacher training.
The adverse effects of physical and mental punishment on the minds of the students in the classroom stays with the students throughout their life.
The development of their personality is hampered due to the physical and emotional punishments of the time when the role of the person in the formation of a person's personality is maximum.
Many people begin to feel hostile about their studies.
In our country, our country was indifferent with the importance of primary and secondary education in the minds of the students, while the education system of many countries was created with great importance o students psychology.
If all the steps in the education sector have played a role in the indifference, it will definitely bring positive results.
If education with fun can be managed in the class, all the students in the class can manage to learn a topic happily, nd learning becomes enjoyable.
And it is also one of the preconditions for achieving the goal of adopting a creative education system instead of punishing or replacing the faculty education system.
Time scale canceled
Private college teacher's diary
Three eggs is needed in the breakfast now.
Two were needed few days ago.
Due to being pregnant, along with father and children myself has to eat them.
Although I do not want to eat.
Demand is increasing day by day in the family.
Taking the daughter to school after finishing breakfast.
Today is also the date of the school's fees.
It took a lot of money for readmission, new books, new dress in the last month.
Tuition must be paid today- says the daughter.
She does not understand, her parents' salary has been stopped for two months.
Rima (pseudonym) and her husband taught in two private colleges in an upazila in Panchagarh district.
Returning from the college, I have to put the marketing list to the husband.
The day when there is no class in the morning, only then grocery shopping is done.
At times there is no adjustment between the market currency and the available money.
The first one is growing, the other one is stopping at one place.
Much like their job.
After getting the highest degree of the university, the entry of the private college in the absence of a golden deer of government jobs.
The age of one of them is 15 years, the other is 12 years old.
After one era, the salary has reached 100 percent.
They do not have to get anything out of it.
Only one increment in the service life - that's only Tk 125.
Rima is not promoted to the position of her assistant professor after being trapped in the 5: 2 ratio, and It is not expected from Rima's husband because she is in the back row.
Yet,in this stagnant state, time scale has sparked the hope.
Apart from entering the seventh grade from the ninth grade, the salary has also been increased from Tk 11,000 to Tk 15,000.
Going to the market means walking on a burning fire.
There are a number of creditors in the market and the price of the goods is too high. on the price of the goods.
Being a permanent resident of the area, it is possible to shop in a grocery store, cloth shop, and even fish and meat shops keeping the price to be paid later.
The shopkeepers also know that there is no time limit for getting paid in the private college.
So the payment is due now, it will be paid after getting the salary.
One of the people came to the house with an invitation card of Halkhata.
In fact, because of two month delay of salary there is a little more due this time.
After the husband's going to the market, Rima spend the most busy time before going to college.
Amidst the household chores, she has to calculate the expenditure of the family.
The housemaid has asked for an increase in her salary;
The girl's music, dance and painting class payment, costs for milk, the girl's and her travels expenditure, entertainment, socialization - Rima stays in a circle.
Two months' salary can be found together, it is comforting to think about it.
She thinks in her mind that during her delivery she can use some money from there.
Rima's husband returned home with anger and pain in the worried face out on the market.
With the daily newspaper in his hand.
Her husband told Rima the description of an unprecedented phenomenon that the private teachers time scale has been canceled, even their grades have been withdrawn from seventh to ninth grade.
What a shame!
There are about six lakh teachers working in private schools in this country.
About six years later, 30 thousand teachers were given time scales.
Those who are not promoted because of the obstacle of proportion, whose job was 15-18 years older, the time scale took them to an honorable position.
It was closed again!
A feeling of childhood comes to the mind Rima.
Mother gave her a new coat.
Rima was delighted, but after a while her mother took off the shirt.
Because, the shirt was not bought for her, It was bought for a relative.
After taking off the new shirt, Rima's eyes were flooded with water.
Today, that feeling came again.
Doing the calculation in her mind Rima tried to find, how much extra money had to be paid for 30 thousand teachers?
About 10-12 crore taka
In this country, the minister-MPs spend more money in their houses-cars.
In this era, is there anyone who gets 100 tk for house rent and 150 tk for medical allowance.
Do teachers of private schools not teach students?
These educational institutions of the rural area are only for students who can not enroll at renown government institution.
Due to this the meritorious face like Rima do not get much.
In order to preserve their salary and allowances, the teachers of these private institutions have to work hard to get good results from these low meritorious students.
The dream of getting two months salary together has been torn apart because it sees light.
After handling the disaster of four consecutive classes, Rima has returned home again to join the household.
Strong attempts to survive the family anyway.
Today the center of the discussion was the cancellation of time scale and the conflict between finance and education ministry.
The conflict is in Rima's mind too.
Can she take care of the child whom she is bringing into world, and who is already there?
Will they get trapped in hobbies and tensions, or will they become perfect citizen through practicing the values of their teacher parents? teachers become good citizens in the ideals of parents?
There is no chance to see it lightly.
Ragging-disorder
In the higher education institutes there is going on a type of silent violence called 'ragging'.
To welcome the new students with cruel and ugly behavior is called 'ragging'.
Recently, while practicing such rights, one of the students of the Chittagong Marine Academy has been stripped of his nails, one's is about to being lost, all the body have been injured of many, one is on the verge of losing mental balance.
11 newbie student has already left the academy.
It is not that The Marine Academy authorities were not aware of the matter, but It is understood the statement of the commandant that they took it lightly.
Want to write fluent English?
While we can speak a little in English, many of us have a shaky state of writing.
The writing of the university examinations, writing of a paper, the application for a fellowship or scholarship, 'the statement of purpose' is not very standard.
The weak sentence structure and the incomprehensible linguistic techniques lends us back.
Talking about the lively and fluent writing in English has been done with Nabira Rahman who is working in an international finance management institute.
She represented Bangladesh in the 2014 UN Economic and Social Council Youth Forum Conference.

Not everything of Facebook is good.
Is everything of Facebook good?
No, not everything of Facebook is good.
Facebook authorities has also admitted it.
Recently, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has confessed this.
She said that all Facebook talk is not good for everyone.
A few months before this comment, the authority acknowledged some bad effects of Facebook.
Then said, when users circulates aimlessly amid the Facebook posts, the mental state starts to get worse.
Sheryl said, Facebook has brought changes in the news feed.
Now those with whom the user has more contacts, their posts are shown more in the news feed.
Studies show that some types of social media use have negative effects on people.
After knowing this, Facebook has brought changes.
A report related to this has been published in variety.com.
Sheryl took part in Wednesday's conference on 'Morgan Stanley's 2012 Technologies, Media and Telecom.'
She said that the study found that all types of communication through social media is not good for everyone.
There are two aspects of social communication that are good and bad.
According to research, it depends on how social media is being used.
Facebook has brought changes in its algorithm in January this year.
Instead of content of third-party publishers, the company has started showing favorite content of family and friends at news feed.
In the face of criticism of failing to prevent false news spread in US elections in 2016 and selling ads to Russia, the company has been criticized for its failure to prevent spreading false news in 2016.
Sandberg said that Facebook has continued to take action against those who try to spread fake news and use this platform for bad intentions..
Sheryl acknowledged, 2017 has been a year of challenge for Facebook.
2018 will be the same.
It could not be made possible to stop the leakage of question paper.
Rather, some questions have been leaked by announcement in advance.
Education secretary has accepted the inability this time.
Two high level committees have been formed, hoping that this committee will provide a clear path to the next course of action.
But the examination question leaks are not new this year, it's been going on for a long time.
Sometimes the education ministry has admitted that, most of the time has been saved by refusing.
Actually the failure to prevent leakage of question papers is not a casualty.
There is also a continuation of failure in many achievements in education.
Once upon a time the Education Minister announced the closure of the note-guide book, but they were not closed.
Coaching centers and tutorials are still being carried out despite illegal declaration of them.
Once upon a time, our public examinations were full of copying, only that came under control, and its achievement will be given to the State Minister for Education Ehsanul Haque Milon.
We do not forget that under the leadership of Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid, there has been a lot of groundbreaking work in the present government.
About 100 percent of children are enrolled in primary schools.
Textbooks are being provided free of cost to the students of all schools every year.
By increasing every year the number has reached 36 crore books this year.
Book text and print-binding are improving.
Girls' education rises in rosy ranks.
The government, the Ministry of Education, should be thanked for the measures they have taken.
But fulfilling the standards of quality education for achieving SDG goals has become a big challenge for us.
For this, such a plan it is necessary.
Similarly, the required funding is a must.
If the goal of education is properly determined, it will be easier to set standards for improvement.
At the same time, we have to consider our domestic reality.
I think, due to confusion in these matters, due to the frequent changes to solve problems, various experimental reformation, complexity and suffering has increased.
As a result, there has created an opposite reality in education.
Today the note-guide book is more important than textbooks, coaching centers are valuable than schools.
Exam has become the main goal shadowing the learning.
Teachers have lost their value to the tutors.
The students become examinees from the beginning.
Serious thought needs to be given on this condition of learning process.
